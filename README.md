# Hacking_Challenge-_Password_Breaker
In this mini-game, the player has to hack into a computer by guessing a seven-letter word that is used as a secret password. The game process is based on the fact that the computer's memory blocks provide possible words, and the player gets hints as to how close his guesses are to the correct password.
